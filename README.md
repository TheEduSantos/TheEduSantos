## About Me
Hello! I am Eduardo, 20 years old, Brazilian, and I am student of Information Security, and Development. Although I have little professional experience, I am extremely motivated to learn and improve my skills.

In my CyberSecurity studies, I've gained knowledge about computer networks, log analysis, and various tools used in ethical hacking/penetration testing. Regarding my studies in programming languages, I have studied programming logic, some programming languages, such as Python (my favorite one) and Ruby, as well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have honed my skills through hands-on experience in diverse projects, guided by tutorials, and self-driven exploration..

Additionally, I am a proactive, organized, and committed individual who strives for high-quality results. I am able to work well in a team, and I am always looking to learn more to develop professionally.
